    <H2>What goes into making fufuf</H2>
    <p>Ingredients</p>
    <ul>
        <li><em>Cassava –</em> Pronounced kuh-sah-vah (if someone asks you); it’s also called yuca. This starchy root vegetable looks like a yam with tree bark on it.<br/> But you can replace it with true yams (, not sweet potatoes). Raw cassava</li>
        <li><em>Plantains –</em> These have more starch than bananas, and you can enjoy them before or after they ripen. For this recipe, you want the green ones.<br/> While this recipe calls for boiling the plantains, they also taste amazing fried! Leave the sweet yellow plantains for another tasty recipe.</li>

    <h2>How to prepare Fufu</h2>
    <p>The following is the Step-by-step process of making fufu</p>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Peel and slice </b>the cassava and plantain with a knife into medium-size pieces, take out the cassava’s core and the plantain’s tiny seeds, and rinse. (Photos 1-4)</li>
        <li><b>Cook Them –</b> Place the pieces in a saucepan, cover with water, and cook over medium heat. Boil for 30 minutes or until fork-tender. Drain the water. (Photos 5-6)</li>
        <li><b>Blend – </b>Add the cooked plantain and cassava to a food processor and blend. Use a spoon to move it around as necessary to ensure even blending.<br/> Add water by the spoonful as needed until you achieve the desired texture.<br/> It should be soft and stretchy. (Photos 7-10)</li>
        <li><b>Smooth – </b>Turn it onto a wet plate or bowl and fold it into itself until it is smooth.</li>
